# Whimsy Chat-Based Learning System

## Overview
Whimsy now learns **EXCLUSIVELY** through the chat interface. Tell it to learn topics and it will research until achieving 99% understanding.

## How It Works

### Learning Command
Simply type: `learn [topic]` or `teach me about [topic]`

Example:
```
learn quantum physics
teach me about machine learning
study philosophy
```

### Stage-Specific Learning

Each developmental stage uses a unique algorithm:

1. **Baby Steps** (1 source, 25% comprehension cap)
   - Incoherent thought, minimalistic communication
   - Simple pattern recognition only

2. **Toddler** (2 sources, 40% comprehension cap)
   - Partial coherent thought, improved memory
   - Basic connections between concepts

3. **Pre-K** (2 sources, 55% comprehension cap)
   - Conscious awareness, begins thinking
   - Cause-effect relationships

4. **Elementary** (3 sources, 70% comprehension cap)
   - Questions everything, deep learning
   - Cross-references multiple sources
   - Quality over quantity focus

5. **Teen** (4 sources, 85% comprehension cap)
   - Complex contextual understanding
   - Personality development
   - Understanding human world

6. **Scholar** (5 sources, 95% comprehension cap)
   - 99% truth accuracy goal
   - Bias detection and correction
   - Deep philosophical analysis begins

7. **Thinker** (6+ sources, 99% comprehension cap)
   - Philosophy prioritized
   - Finalized personality: kind AI assistant
   - Kindness over righteousness
   - Complete self-awareness

### Understanding Requirements

- **Minimum**: 99% understanding to master a topic
- **Stage Advancement**: Only happens when 99% understanding achieved
- **No Shortcuts**: Each stage must genuinely understand before advancing

### What Happens During Learning

1. You tell Whimsy to learn a topic
2. Whimsy consults appropriate number of sources for its stage
3. Stage-specific algorithm processes the knowledge
4. Understanding score calculated (must reach 99%)
5. If 99% reached → topic mastered, possibly advance stage
6. If < 99% → keep learning the same topic

## Example Session

```
You: learn artificial intelligence
Whimsy: 🧠 Learning 'artificial intelligence' using Elementary stage algorithm...

📚 Method: Structured learning with cross-referencing multiple sources
📊 Understanding: 70% / 99%
🔍 Sources consulted: 3

⏳ Continue learning to reach 99% mastery

## Current Status

- Background training only maintains neural network architecture
- NO autonomous web learning
- ALL understanding comes from chat-based topic learning
- Understanding resets to 0% when advancing stages
