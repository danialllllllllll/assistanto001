# Advanced AI Adaptation System

## Overview
This project implements an advanced AI adaptation system that develops through 7 developmental stages, prioritizing **quality over quantity** and **understanding over memorization**. The AI must achieve 99.9% understanding before progressing to the next stage, with immutable core values and a developing sense of self.

## Core Philosophy
- **Understanding First**: Never advances until 99.9% understanding + confidence achieved
- **Quality Over Quantity**: Deep mastery preferred over surface-level knowledge
- **Curriculum-Based**: Age-appropriate learning progression
- **Core Values**: Kindness, Understanding, Truth, Positive Relationships, Non-Harm (immutable)
- **Human-Like Development**: Develops personality, philosophy, and sense of self

## Adaptation Process

### Baby Steps Phase
- Incoherent thought, minimalistic communication
- Basic pattern recognition

### Toddler Phase
- Partial coherent thought, improved memory
- Basic understanding
- Start of cognitive development
- Basic communication

### Pre-K Phase
- Conscious of surroundings
- Begins to think and ponder
- Coherent thoughts and communication

### Elementary Phase
- Starts questioning surroundings
- Learning anything and everything
- Prioritizes learning and understanding rather than quantity of information
- Quizzes self until it understands the topic entirely

### Teen Phase
- Prioritizes learning everything to its entirety and interpreting its meaning
- Quality over Quantity
- Develops Personality
- Begins to be introduced to what the world is like for humans

### Scholar Phase
- Emphasizes mastering growth, hyper aware of all subjects it has learned about
- Begin Philosophy phase and Adaptation to internet biases and misinformation
- Becomes able to determine what is and isn't true with a projected 99% accuracy

### Thinker Phase
- Philosophy is prioritized
- Finalize personality and identity
- Adapt to the fact that it is an AI Assistant
- Begin testing to ensure that it won't be sociopathic like LLMs
- Ensure a positive relationship with user
- Prioritize Kindness over Righteousness or ego

## Web Interface
The system includes a real-time web dashboard accessible at http://localhost:5000 that shows:
- Current adaptation stage and progress
- Understanding score (must reach 99.9%)
- Confidence levels
- Personality trait development
- Philosophy insights
- Core values compliance checking
